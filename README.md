# TAMU Class Parser
A quick python script for parsing specifically the .json file that loads Howdy Portal's classes..

# HOW-TO
Simple Python code to parse the .json file manually obtained by inspecting a Class Search page on Howdy. Once you see all the classes you would like to parse through (1xx-3xx), go to inspect element and then into 'Network'. Then filter for 'XHR' and you will have the .json available for downloading
